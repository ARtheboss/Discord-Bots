About Discord-Bots:
I am starting this repo by creating a Discord bot that will upload history memes
to a Discord every day, and this folder contains all of the bots that I have worked on.

How to use the bot:
Create a .env file with the following information:

1. From your Reddit API:
   a. Project name
   b. Secret
   c. Client ID
2. From your Discord guild and API:
   a. Interested Guild(s) (e.g., SAS Quiz Club)
   b. Guilds' ID
   c. Token for the bot you created
   d. Channel ID
   
Here's an article to help you understand the Discord part of my code: https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/.
   
You need to sign up for a developers account for Discord and need to create an API for Reddit.
Aside from that, this script runs on a schedule through the cloud to give the chat memes every day.
Edit the bot according to your meme-ing needs (remove the r/historymemes link and put in your own Reddit link).
If you want to make a suggestion to the code, please email them to me at babu786277@sas.edu.sg.
